# GeodesicIntegrator

A simple code to calculate geodesics using a given space-time using MPI to
accelerate. It can just create geodesic traces or render pictures of simple 
geometries positioned in space-time. ( See example below )

The metric components are written in a class and then
passed as a template to the geodesic_shooter or render class to simplify the
complexity of the code
